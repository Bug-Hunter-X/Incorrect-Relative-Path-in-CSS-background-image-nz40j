The solution is to use a correct relative path or an absolute path.  This assumes that `image.png` is in the same directory as the HTML file.
```css
.element {
  background-image: url('../images/image.png'); /* Correct relative path */
}
```
Alternatively, use an absolute path if the location of the image is known relative to the server's root directory.
```css
.element {
  background-image: url('/images/image.png'); /* Absolute path */
}
```
